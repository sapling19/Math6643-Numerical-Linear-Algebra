This file contains the Matlab codes for generating figures for problem 4 and 5.

The main code for the problems are:
(1) Problem 4: math6643_HW3_p4;
(2) Problem 5a: math6643_HW3_p5a;
(3) Problem 5b: math6643_HW3_p5b.

All three codes may take significant time to complete. When running the codes they will automatically generate a series of figures and save/close the pop-up figures. All the figures have been provided in the hard copy of the assignment solutions.
