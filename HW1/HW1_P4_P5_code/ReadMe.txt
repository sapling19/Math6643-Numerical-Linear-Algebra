This file contains the Matlab codes for generating figures for problem 4 and 5.

The main code for the problems are:
(1) Problem 4: math6643_HW1_p4;
(2) Problem 5: math6643_HW1_p5.

Both of the codes may take significant time to complete. When running the codes they will automatically generate a series of figures and save/close the pop-up figures. All the figures have been provided as attachments in the hard copy of the assignment solutions.
